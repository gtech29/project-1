        <h1>Band History</h1>
        <p>
          The Doors was an American rock band that was formed in Los Angeles in the year 1965. The band members included
          Jim
          Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (keyboards), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums). They were among
          the most
          controversial and powerful rock groups of the 1960s, featuring their distinctive sound, which combined rock
          with blues,
          jazz, and psychedelic music, and poetic and provocative lyrics by Morrison. The Doors were commercially
          successful, with
          hits such as "Light My Fire," Break on Through (To the other Side) and "Riders on the Storm." Before the
          sad and
          untimely death of Morrison in 1971, the band released six studio albums, but the other members continued to
          perform and
          record a few years afterwards. The legacy of the Doors lasts until nowadays, and they are globally considered
          one of the
          most significant rock bands ever.
