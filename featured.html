        <p>
          The Doors released six studio albums during their career, each of them with a unique sound and style. Some
          of
          their most
          influential songs include "Light My Fire," "Break on Through (To the Other Side)," "Riders on the Storm,"
          "People Are
          Strange," and "The End." These songs are considered classics of rock music and have been covered by many
          artists over the years. The Doors' music continues to be celebrated for its innovation, poetic lyrics, and
          powerful performances.
