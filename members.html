        <h1>Band Members</h1>
        <p>
          The Doors was a band composed of four main members:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jim Morrison</strong> - Lead vocals, lyrics</li>
          <li><strong>Ray Manzarek</strong> - Keyboards, vocals</li>
          <li><strong>Robby Krieger</strong> - Guitar, vocals</li>
          <li><strong>John Densmore</strong> - Drums, vocals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each member of The Doors contributed to the band's unique sound and style, blending rock, blues, and
          psychedelic music. Jim Morrison's poetic lyrics and charismatic stage presence were a defining aspect of
          the band's identity, while Ray Manzarek's keyboard playing added a distinctive layer to their music. Robby
          Krieger's guitar work provided a dynamic range of sounds, and John Densmore's drumming added rhythm and
          energy to their performances. Together, they created a lasting legacy in the world of rock music.
