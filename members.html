              <h2>Singer and lyricist of The Doors</h2>
              <p>Known as the Lizard King, Morrison combined poetry, rebellion, as well as theatrical stage persona to
                re-establish the
                position of the rock frontman. His lyrics have addressed the freedom, mysticism and the darker aspects
                of human nature.</p>

          Each member of The Doors contributed to the band's unique sound and style, blending rock, blues, and
          psychedelic music. Jim Morrison's poetic lyrics and charismatic stage presence were a defining aspect of
          the band's identity, while Ray Manzarek's keyboard playing added a distinctive layer to their music. Robby
          Krieger's guitar work provided a dynamic range of sounds, and John Densmore's drumming added rhythm and
          energy to their performances. Together, they created a lasting legacy in the world of rock music.
