        <h1>Band Members</h1>
        <p>
          The Doors was a band composed of four main members:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <button popovertarget="Jim Morrison"><strong>Jim Morrison</strong></button>
            <div popover id="Jim Morrison" class="member-popover"><img src="./media/images/jim.jpg">
              <h2>Singer and lyricist of The Doors</h2>
              <p>Known as the Lizard King, Morrison combined poetry, rebellion, as well as theatrical stage persona to
                re-establish the
                position of the rock frontman. His lyrics have addressed the freedom, mysticism and the darker aspects
                of human nature.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li> <button popovertarget="Ray Manzarek"><strong>Ray Manzarek</strong></button>
            <div popover id="Ray Manzarek" class="member-popover"><img src="./media/images/ray.png">
              <h2>Co-founder, keyboardist of the Doors.</h2>
              <p>A classically trained musician, he blended rock, jazz, and blues into the band&apos;s distinctive
                psychedelic sound. His
                innovative keyboard bass lines defined many of The Doors&apos; most iconic songs.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li> <button popovertarget="Robby Krieger"><strong>Robby Krieger</strong></button>
            <div popover id="Robby Krieger" class="member-popover"><img src="./media/images/robby.jpg">
              <h2>Songwriter and Guitarist in The Doors.</h2>
              <p>He is recognized as an expressive slide guitarist with the style
                of combining
                genres and has written the number one hit of the band known as Light My Fire. Krieger would later
                develop a prosperous
                career as a jazz guitarist with influence of flamenco and jazz.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li> <button popovertarget="John Densmore"><strong>John Densmore</strong></button>
            <div popover id="John Densmore" class="member-popover"><img src="./media/images/john.jpg">
              <h2>Drummer of The Doors.</h2>
              <p>Densmore influenced the sound of the band by bringing into it energy and form of jazz and Brazilian
                beats, and also
                musical depth. In addition to The Doors, he was a writer, a theatrical writer, and arts supporter.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each member of The Doors contributed to the band's unique sound and style, blending rock, blues, and
          psychedelic music. Jim Morrison's poetic lyrics and charismatic stage presence were a defining aspect of
          the band's identity, while Ray Manzarek's keyboard playing added a distinctive layer to their music. Robby
          Krieger's guitar work provided a dynamic range of sounds, and John Densmore's drumming added rhythm and
          energy to their performances. Together, they created a lasting legacy in the world of rock music.
