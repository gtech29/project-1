# Project — AI Literacy Interview Chatbot (Custom GPT)

The scope of this project is to design and test a Custom GPT that is an interview practice tool to students in teacher preparation programs. It also aims to promote moral, thought-provoking, and critical interaction with AI technologies in educational organizations.
The tool will be created as an AI Grant in partnership with the College of Education.

---

## Overview

This project is intended to support AI literacy by using a structured interview chatbot as a learning tool rather than as an authority. Students interact with a Custom GPT configured with a consistent persona and then reflect on the AI’s behavior, limitations, bias, and appropriate use in educational contexts.

My role involves designing the **user flow** (for both instructors and students), configuring and documenting the **Custom GPT**, and supporting **reflection, survey design, and data analysis** to evaluate the impact of AI integration on student learning. The project emphasizes transparency, ethical use, and scalability across courses.

## Project Goals (Checklist)

- [ ] Define a clear **student user flow** for interacting with the interview chatbot
- [ ] Define a clear **instructor user flow** for creating and deploying the GPT
- [ ] Create and document a **Custom GPT interview persona**
- [ ] Support **AI literacy** through guided reflection and journaling
- [ ] Design **pre- and post-surveys** to measure learning outcomes
- [ ] Plan **data collection and analysis** aligned with grant goals
- [ ] Produce documentation that supports **scaling** to additional courses
- [ ] Contribute to materials suitable for **scholarly dissemination**

## What This Project Does

### AI Interview Chatbot

The Custom GPT functions as a **mock interviewer** that students engage with during a structured activity. The chatbot is designed to be consistent, constrained, and transparent, allowing students to practice interviewing while critically examining AI behavior.

The focus is not on perfect interview performance, but on helping students:

- Question AI authority
- Identify bias and assumptions
- Understand how AI responses are shaped
- Reflect on when AI should or should not be used in classrooms

## User Flows

### Student Flow

1. Student logs in using CSUN credentials
2. Student reviews the purpose of the activity and AI expectations
3. Student launches the interview chatbot via a provided link
4. Student conducts an interview with the GPT persona
5. Student completes guided reflection prompts
6. Student submits a survey or reflective assignment

---

### Instructor Flow

1. Instructor logs in using CSUN credentials
2. Instructor opens the Custom GPT creation interface
3. Instructor copies or imports the interview GPT template
4. Instructor customizes the persona or interview focus (optional)
5. Instructor saves and publishes the GPT
6. Instructor shares the GPT link and reflection instructions with students

---

## Reflection and Data Collection

Reflection and survey components are used to evaluate changes in AI literacy and ethical awareness. These materials are designed to capture student thinking about:

- Bias and limitations in AI outputs
- Authority and trust in AI-generated information
- Ethical decision-making around AI use in education

Data collection methods may include reflective journaling, pre/post surveys, and aggregate usage insights, depending on platform and privacy constraints.

---

## Tools Used

- **Custom GPT (CSUN account)** — interview chatbot configuration
- **Canvas or Google Forms** — reflection and survey collection
- **Spreadsheets / Python (optional)** — organizing and analyzing results
- **Documentation (README / guides)** — supporting faculty adoption and scaling
