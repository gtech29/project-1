# Project 1 - HTML/CSS

This assignment is aimed at creating and coding a web site based on HTML and CSS without libraries and without any automated CSS formators.
In this project, I decided to create a web site about my favorite band, The Doors. The site is dedicated to good organization, HTML semantics, and structured styling with the help of an external CSS file.

## Project Purpose

- The goal of this website is to:
  - Adhere to web best practices that were discussed in class.
  - Demonstrate how headings and document outlines may be used to good advantage.
  - Have structured and semantic html content.

## Website Overview

- The website includes:

  - Home Page – Introduction to the band

  - Band History – Overview of The Doors’ career and impact

  - Featured Albums – Highlighted music and discography

  - Band Members – Information about each member

The pages are all styled from a common external stylesheet, to help maintain a style.
