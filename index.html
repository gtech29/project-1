        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          With the growing presence of generative technologies in education and the workplace, future educators need to
          be ready
          not only to utilize them, but also to critically evaluate their drawbacks, their assumptions and ethical
          implications.
          This project examines how teachers and students can use interview simulators, which utilize large language
          models, both
          as a part of teacher education coursework and view students as active participants in technological use.

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            As a student myself, I have experienced the pressure of interviewing for jobs, and even with the best
            preparation and
            planning, interviews can be tense and dicey. This project will offer teacher candidates a favorable space
            that will
            assist them in practicing interview situations, developing their communication abilities, and self-assessing
            their
            progress.

            <summary><strong>How Students Use It</strong></summary>
          
            <p>
              Students start with an initial selection of a mock teaching interview scenario and answer structured interview questions
              aimed at simulating the experience of an actual hiring scenario.
            </p>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Submit responses to realistic interview prompts</li>
              <li>Receive structured feedback focused on clarity and professionalism</li>
              <li>Reflect on strengths and areas for improvement</li>
              <li>Revise and refine original responses</li>
              <li>Evaluate the accuracy and limitations of automated feedback</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>
              Repetition and reflection allows the student to gain confidence in the interview process and learn how to critically
              evaluate the technologies employed in conversation.

        <h2 id="project-outcomes-title">What the Interview Simulator Does</h2>
      
        <p>
          The interview simulator offers teaching related interview questions, which are structured and enable the applicants to
          be involved in practice questions that occur in life-like situations.
          Designed as a practice partner rather than an authority, the simulator
          encourages revision, reflection, and critical engagement with automated
          feedback. It gives immediate feedback that focuses on clarity, professionalism and completeness of communication.
