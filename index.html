          In this website, I highlight one of my main interests: my favorite band, <i>The Doors</i>. The site offers a short
          summary of
          their music career, lists some of their most impactful music and the members that formed their sound and their
          legacy.

          <p>
            I chose <i>The Doors</i> for this project because they have had a strong influence on my appreciation for
            music. Their distinctive
            sound and lyrical poetry made them stand out of the rest of the bands of their era. Doing this site enabled
            me not only
            to investigate their history, but also to use the concepts of HTML and CSS, in a
            purposeful and
            personal manner.
